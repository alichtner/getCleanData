The file "run_Analysis.R", available in this repo, is a script which reads in raw data generated from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set available from UCI. The script combines both the testing and training datasets. It then merges these data with information about the subjects and activities that each observation refers to. No transformations are performed. At this point, only the columns referring to mean and standard deviations from each measurement are retained.

The final clean dataset generated by the script lists averages for each variable grouped by each subject and activity. 

- i.e. There will be six rows referring to subject one: 1) Walking 2) Walking_Upstairs 3) Walking_Downstairs 4) Sitting 5) Standing 6) Laying

The final dataset contains 180 observations of 79 variables (30 subjects and 6 activities x 79 measurements)

The columns are:

- Column 1 - <b>Subject</b> - numbered 1 to 30
- Column 2 - <b>Activity</b> - factor variable: Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying
- Columns 3 to 81 - 79 average means and average standard deviations of acceleration measurements made from the wearable devices. These numbers are derived from the accelerometers and gyroscopes contained within the Samsung phone used by the test subjects.
